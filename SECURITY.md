## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities by emailing **security@example.com**. Include a description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and any relevant logs or screenshots.

We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within **3 business days**. After triage, we will keep you informed about the status of the issue. If a fix is required, we strive to release a patch within **30 days** of the initial report.

If we determine that a reported issue does not constitute a vulnerability or will not be addressed, we will provide a clear explanation. We encourage continued discussion if you believe the issue remains unresolved.

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure.
